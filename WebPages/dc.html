<h4><b> <u>About </u></h4></b>
<p>The Delhi Capitals are a franchise cricket team that represents the city of Delhi in the Indian Premier League (IPL). Founded in 2008 as the Delhi Daredevils, the franchise is owned by the GMR Group and the JSW Group. The team's home ground is Arun Jaitley Stadium, located in New Delhi.

Ahead of the 2018 IPL season, 50% of the franchise ownership was transferred to the JSW Group. In December 2018, the team changed its name from the Delhi Daredevils to the Delhi Capitals.[2] Speaking to the rationale behind changing the team's name, co-owner and chairman Parth Jindal said, "Delhi is the power centre of the country, it is the capital, therefore the name Delhi Capitals."[3] Co-owner Kiran Kumar Grandhi said, "The new name symbolizes Delhiâ€™s identity and just like the city, we are aiming to be the centre of all action going forward."[4]

The Delhi Capitals are the only current team to have never appeared in an IPL final,[5] and last qualified for the IPL playoffs in 2019.[6] The leading run-scorer for the Capitals is Virender Sehwag, while the leading wicket-taker is Amit Mishra.</p>
