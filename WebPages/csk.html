<h4><b> <u>About </u></h4></b>
<p>The Chennai Super Kings (CSK) are an Indian franchise cricket team based in Chennai, Tamil Nadu, which plays in the Indian Premier League (IPL). Founded in 2008, the team plays its home matches at the M. A. Chidambaram Stadium in Chennai. After serving a two-year suspension from the IPL starting July 2015 for the alleged involvement of their owners in the 2013 IPL betting case (along with Rajasthan Royals),[2] the Super Kings returned to the league in 2018, winning the championship in the comeback season, its third overall to tie Mumbai Indians for the then record for most IPL title wins. The team is captained by Mahendra Singh Dhoni who has led the team to three victories since 2008 and coached by Stephen Fleming.

The Super Kings have lifted the IPL title thrice (in 2010, 2011 and 2018), and have the best win percentage among all teams in the IPL (61.28).[3] They hold the records of most appearances in the IPL playoffs (ten) and have made it to the playoffs in each season they have featured in the league, being the only team to do so. They also have made into a record eight finals out of ten seasons making them one of the most successful franchises in the IPL. In addition, they have also won the Champions League Twenty20 in 2010 and 2014. The brand value of the Super Kings in 2019 is estimated to be around â‚¹732 crore (roughly $104 million), making them the second-most valuable IPL franchise, after Mumbai Indians.[4]</p>
